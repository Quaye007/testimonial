          a friend who recommended it. The prices are a lot less 
          when bought from the vendor directly.I recently graduated
           with a finance degree but am looking to continue developing
            my coding abilities. At first glance, I thought codecademy 
            was a great way to advance my desired skills. I tried the
             service for a week and it was great. At the time, I didn't
              have room in my busy schedule to continue using the
service. Due to my work travels, I missed the deadline
 to cancel my subscription by less than 24 hours. Low
                 and behold, when I contacted their customer support
                  to ask for a reimbursement I was given a cold and 
                  harsh no. I offered many solutions to prove this human 
                  error, such as my lack of activity during the time since I
                   was automatically charged, but nothing. What is worse, 
                   I did not even receive an email reminder that the charge
                    was being automatically renewed.  " </P>
